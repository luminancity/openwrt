This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.
Ubuntu 20.04:
  There are missing shared libraries. Make symlinks from the /snap/core18/current/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
  directory pointing to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ folder:
    libncurses.so.5
    libtinfo.so.5

0.8 Clone the forked openwrt repo from Luminancity:
    git clone git@github.com:luminancity/openwrt.git

0.9 Clone the evc_apps repo into the root directory and check out the desired branch/tag
    An evc_apps subdir shall be created under the root directory. It contains all
    applications developed by Luminancity.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2.1 Check the diff of the .config file. It is confused after feed update. Restore the original
    version located in the repo.

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make -j4" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

5. The flash image will be generated under bin/targets/--/--/--/*-sysupgrade.bin
   The size shall be ~12M. It is suitable for web flashing.
